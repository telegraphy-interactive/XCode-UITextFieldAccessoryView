XCode-UITextFieldAccessoryView
==============================

TTAITextAuxInput decorates a UITextField, uses the inputAccessoryView to present 'cancel', 'undo', and 'done' buttons.

TTAITextDatePicker extends TTAITextAuxInput, additionally decorating a UITextField with a UIDatePicker for input.

TTAIViewController demonstrates usage.

The example includes a model with persistance.  It tests and demonstrates full integration into a working application.  It is a complete MVC application example with persistance and custom keyboards for data entry into a text field.

Developed with Xcode v4.6

Thanks to Walter Deering for the key architecture that makes the "done" button work.
