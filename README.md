XCode-UITextFieldAccessoryView
==============================

TTAITextAuxInputView uses UITextField inputAccessoryView to dismiss Decimal style keypad.

TTAITextDatePicker uses UITextField inputView and inputAccessoryView to modify a date field with date picker and dismiss.

TTAIViewController demonstrates usage.

These developed with Xcode v4.6

Thanks to Walter Deering for the key architecture that makes the "done" button work.
